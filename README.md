# MarsRover

1. As NASA, I want to input the upper-right point's x and y coordinates of the rectangular plateau
So that I know the boundaries of where the rover can go.

2. As NASA, I want to input the x and y coordinates and orientation of the rover
So that I can position the rover on the plateau the way I want to.

3. As NASA, after entering the x and y coordinates and orientation of the rover,
I want to input a set of instructions for the rover to execute
So that the rover can scan the area I want it to.

4. As NASA, after I have entered the upper-right point's x and y coordinates of the rectangular plateau, 
I want to input multiple rovers' positions, orientations and sets of instructions 
so that I can direct multiple rovers to scan the plateau.

5. As NASA, after I have input multiple rovers' positions, orientations and sets of instructions,
I want to see each rover's final coordinates and heading output
So that I can make a decisions on their next move.
